PHASE 1 – STRUCTURE FRAME
==================================================
OBJECTIVE: Build a sturdy Technic-based skeleton to support tower walls, roof, and future detailing.

SCALE: Covers approx. 48 × 16 studs (center base of model)

REQUIRED PARTS:
• 3703 – Technic Brick 1x16 (x16)
• 3894 – Technic Brick 1x12 (x12)
• 64179 – Technic Frame 5x7 Open Center (x6)
• 3705 – Axle 6L (x12)
• 2780 – Technic Friction Pin (x10)

STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: CREATE LONGITUDINAL BEAMS  
Use (2) Technic Brick 1×16 (3703)  
- Lay them parallel, 16 studs apart  
- This forms the *spine* of the frame  
- Align with stud grid: start one at Row 1, the other at Row 17 (assuming standard baseplate grid)

STEP 2: ADD CROSS-BRACES  
Use (4) Technic Brick 1×12 (3894)  
- Connect the two spine bricks with 1×12s, spaced evenly  
  - Suggested cross points at Stud 0, 6, 12, and 18  
- Snap in at pin holes, not just on studs — this will carry vertical loads

STEP 3: INSTALL STRUCTURAL STRUTS  
Use (3) Technic Frame 5×7 (64179)  
- Position one frame dead center across the beams  
- Place others near front and rear  
- Frames should mount over pin connections, not float  
- Orient open sides vertically to allow interior support posts later

STEP 4: LOCK AXLE GRID  
Use (6) Axle 6L (3705)  
- Insert axles horizontally between Technic bricks, threading through pin holes  
- Place at positions: Rows 3, 8, and 13 (two axles per row, left/right side)  
- This reinforces lateral strength

STEP 5: INSERT FRICTION PINS  
Use (10) Technic Pin with Friction (2780)  
- Insert pins into *unused* Technic holes around each junction (approx. 2–3 pins per 5×7 frame)  
- This will stabilize the core under vertical compression

STEP 6: STACK UPPER LAYER  
Repeat Steps 1–4 one level higher using remaining Technic Bricks  
- Create a **second identical rectangle** atop the first  
- Offset joints if possible (e.g. don’t place 1×12 over 1×12 seam)  
- Secure with additional axles or pins as needed

FINAL CHECK:
✅ Frame must be square  
✅ Should withstand slight twisting by hand without flexing  
✅ If you're planning electronics later (lights or motors), leave an opening near the rear crossbeam
